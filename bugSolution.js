// This file demonstrates a potential solution to the bug

// Example to ensure correct Android emulator setup (not directly related to the bug):
// This should be checked as a part of debugging steps
const emulatorIsRunning = checkEmulator(); // replace with a function to check emulator
if (!emulatorIsRunning) {
  console.log('Emulator is not running. Please start the emulator manually before running Expo Start.');
} else {
  console.log('Emulator is running. Proceeding with Expo Start...');
}

//Rest of the code remains same
